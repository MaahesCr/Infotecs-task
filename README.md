# infotecs-task
The project is a test task for Infotecs. To display the page, you will need to run the createFile.js file. To do this, you need to write in the console: "node createFile.js". An index.html file will be created. The logic of the file is located in the main.js document. At the moment, all basic functions are implemented (
● Based on the existing array of data, create a table with a width of 50% of the screen;
● Columns in the table:
    ○
    Name (firstName),
    ○
    Surname (lastName),
    ○
    Description (about),
    ○
    Eye color (eyeColor).
● The “about” column data should be displayed in two lines, the rest is cut off
ellipsis (...);
● Each column must have a sort property;
● When clicking on a row in the DIV adjacent to the table, display the data editing form
selected line).

The project is not in the final version and will be finalized.
